## What

Starting from April 29, 2024, all individual contributors' contributions are only possibly accepted after they sign the CLA.

We do not accept corporate contributions at this moment.

You can check out [CLA](./CLA.md).

## Steps

1. Make some changes to the code. Open a pull request.
2. A rebot will check the status.
